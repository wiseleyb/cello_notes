Very much a work in progress.  This is only up on github as a backup and so I can synch with other computers I work on.  Not ready for use, collaboration or much else right now (but will be soon).

Eventually this will be a learning tool for cello (and eventually other instruments).  It will allow the user to hear/see [note, fingering, lettered note ("A", "D", etc.), staved note (sheet music)] and then match it up with other elements of that array in a quiz like style.
